# CG Model
A CG model of Polystyrene (PS) with chain length 10. Each monomer is coarse-grained to a CG bead.
## IBI Potential
The potentials take the table format developed by Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI) method. The details about IBI method can be found elsewhere (10.1002/jcc.10307, 10.1021/ma801910r).

Units:
1. pair potential: $nm, kJ/mol$
2. bond potential: $nm, kJ/mol$
3. angle potential: $rad, kJ/mol$
## Memory Kernel
Units: $ps$, $amu \cdot ps^{-2}$
